# Scripts
This is a collection of scripts that I use to automate my day-to-day tasks.

## Using these scripts
If you want to use these scripts:
- checkout the repo
- add `source path/to/checkout/setup.sh` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file
- open a new shell environment

## Currently Available Commands
- `ssm` from `aws/ssm.sh` => Simplifies logging into AWS SSM with SSO.
